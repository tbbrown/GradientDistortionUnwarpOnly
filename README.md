#GradientDistortionUnwarpOnly

## Script Description

The GradientDistortionUnwarpOnly.sh script performs "only" Gradient Distortion 
Correction for unprocessed images found in the "_unproc" resources for a 
specified [Human Connectome Project][HCP] (HCP) project and subject.

This script was written for the "unprocessed" data release for the LifeSpan
Phase 1a project. LifeSpan is a potential long-term follow up project to the 
[HCP][HCP]

The associated BatchUnwarp.sh script is an example of a way to submit a 
batch of such unwarping jobs to a Sun/Oracle Grid Engine.
